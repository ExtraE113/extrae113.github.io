### Hey, friend.

I'm a high school student interested in cybersecurity, programming, backpacking, lighting design, sailing, community service, and more.

I'm currently mostly focused on schoolwork and [my donation app for the Alemeda County Community Food Bank](github.com/ExtraE113/bowie), but [this](https://github.com/ExtraE113/wikipedia) is on the back burner. I made [this](http://ezranewman.com/ross) in an afternoon recently.
